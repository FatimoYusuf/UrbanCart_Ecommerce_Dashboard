## ‚ùì Business Problem

UrbanCart, a mid-sized e-commerce company, has experienced increasing sales and steady order growth. However, profit remains inconsistent. Management is concerned that high discounting, underperforming regions, or unprofitable products may be responsible.

They need a dashboard that:
- Explores **why profits are dropping** despite rising sales
- Highlights **top and underperforming** products/customers/countries
- Helps make **data-driven decisions** quickly

---

## üîç Key Questions Answered

- Why is profit decreasing while sales are increasing?
- Which product categories drive the most profit?
- Are there unprofitable segments dragging overall performance?
- Who are our top customers by profit?
- What is the profit margin trend over the years?
- How do sales and cost relate across categories?
- How are sales and profit distributed across countries?
- Is the business becoming more efficient or losing revenue due to cost?

## üß† Challenges Faced

- **Discount not found in dataset**: Tried calculating discount from unit price and sales, but most values returned zero ‚Äî suggesting no discount was recorded.
- **Waterfall Chart Logic**: Initially tried to sort by profit, but only showed red bars. Sorting by year gave better trend visualization.
- **Choosing Customer Ranking**: Struggled between using "Top Customers by Sales" vs. "by Profit" ‚Äî chose profit to align with the core problem.
- **Page Design**: Unsure whether to use two or three pages. Settled on two for clarity and story flow.
- **Visual Placement**: Faced layout limits, especially when deciding what to remove to make space for valuable visuals like scatter plots.
- **Color Consistency**: Adjusted scatter and tree map visuals to match brand colors.
